//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree: bfs

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: bfs(하나하나 길이 너무 길면 다른길로 가기힘들다..)

//If the tree is very wide: dfs (3번째 깊이에 있었다면.. 가로가 1000개라면..1000개 다돌고 다음레벨로 갈꺼ㅇ기에)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: dfs

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: dfs

//Finding the shortest path: bfs
